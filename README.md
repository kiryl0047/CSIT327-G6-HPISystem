1. Executive Summary  
Healthcare Patient Information System (HPIS) is a web-based platform designed to help  
local clinics and barangay health centers efficiently manage patient information. The system  
centralizes patient records, appointment scheduling, medicine prescriptions, and patient  
history. Additionally, it provides basic health analytics such as patient visit frequency and most  
common illnesses. HPIS reduces manual paperwork, improves healthcare delivery, and enables  
data-driven decision-making.
  
3. Background / Problem Statement  
Healthcare providers in local clinics and barangay health centers face challenges with  
manual or semi-digital record keeping:  
• Current Challenges:  
o Lost or incomplete patient records.  
o Difficulty in tracking appointments and follow-ups.  
o Inefficient prescription management.  
o No insights on patient trends or common illnesses.  
  
• Opportunity:  
 Implementing a web-based patient information system allows clinics to manage  
records efficiently, track patient trends, and provide faster, more accurate healthcare  
services.  
  
3. Project Objectives  
• Primary Objective: Develop and deploy a web-based Healthcare Patient Information  
System for local clinics and barangay health centers.
  
 • Specific Objectives (SMART):  
 1. Deploy a fully functional web system with secure login by Q4 2025.  
 2. Implement patient record management, appointment scheduling, and prescription  
 tracking modules.  
 3. Include a basic analytics dashboard for patient visit frequency and common illnesses.  
 4. Achieve 90% staff adoption within the first 3 months of deployment.  
 5. Ensure secure storage and backup of patient data with compliance to privacy standards.  
4. Scope of Work  
In-Scope:  
• Web application for healthcare staff.  
• Patient record management, appointment scheduling, prescription tracking, and history  
logging.  
• Basic health analytics module.  
• Secure data storage and backup.  
Out-of-Scope:  
• Mobile app development.
